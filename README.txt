PIP ABSTRACTIONS - TINY PATCHES FOR MAKING GAME AUDIO WITH PD EASIER!
=====================================================================

This bite-sized set of patches is specifically geared towards making
sound for games with Puredata, using Unity and libpd, for example.
Pip abstractions are vanilla and thus libpd friendly.

Included is a basic set of abstractions that can be used by the experimentally-inclined
game composer/sound designer to quickly test out some interactive music ideas, play some samples as sound effects,experiment with real time generated music and patterns and generally just have fun trying out PD as an audio engine for games! 

This is by no means an "advanced" collection of über-patches, but a little set of building blocks to spark the interest of PD beginners and game audio people curious about this great program.

P.S. In order to use PD with Unity, you should download Kalimba:

Thanks to: the Puredata Forums and PDlist for an amazing and alive community, Sebi Dorda for coding Kalimba, Peter Brinkmann for making libpd, RJ-DJ for their amazing toolset, Cheetomoskeeto for the Youtube Tutorials (highly recommended!)
